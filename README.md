## How its made: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExchangeRate-API, Country Flags API
The country codes and currencies are a JSON object in a separate JS file. In the main JS file, an option tag holds the values of the JSON object using a template literal. Clicking the exchange arrows reverses the conversion.

## To be done:
Make it responsive.
